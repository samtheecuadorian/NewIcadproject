      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>It is easy to make the LED blink on an Arduino. We turn it on, wait, turn it off, wait again, and
then we repeat the cycle.</p> 
        <p> The Arduino boards come with an internal LED connected to pin 13. It is simple to
use and always there. But most times we want our own LEDs in different places of our system.
We might connect something on top of the Arduino board and can no longer see the internal
LED. Here, we will explore how to connect an external LED.</p>

    <h2>Getting ready</h2>
     <p>For this recipe, we need the following ingredients:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>An Arduino board connected to the computer via USB</li>
         <li>A breadboard and jumper wires</li>
         <li>A regular LED (the typical LED size is 3 mm)</li>
         <li>A resistor between 220â€“1,000 ohm</li>
      </ul>
   </article>
   <article class='steps'>
    <h2>How To Do It</h2>
     <p>Follow these steps to connect an external LED to an Arduino board:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mount the resistor on the breadboard. Connect one end of the resistor to a digital
    pin on the Arduino board using a jumper wire.</li>
        <li>Mount the LED on the breadboard. Connect the anode (+) pin of the LED to the
    available pin on the resistor. We can determine the anode on the LED in two ways.
    Usually, the longer pin is the anode. Another way is to look for the flat edge on the
    outer casing of the LED. The pin next to the flat edge is the cathode (-).</li>
        <li> Connect the LED cathode (-) to the Arduino GND using jumper wires.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>The following code will make the external LED blink:</p>
       <code> // Declare the LED pin </code><br>
       <code>int LED = 2;</code><br>
       <code>void setup() { </code><br>
       <code>// Declare the pin for the LED as Output</code><br>
       <code class='indent'> pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);</code><br>
       <code>} </code><br>
       <code>void loop(){</code><br>
       <code>// Here we will turn the LED ON and wait 200 milliseconds</code><br>
       <code class='indent'> digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);</code><br>
       <code class='indent'> delay(200);</code><br>
       <code>// Here we will turn the LED OFF and wait 200 milliseconds</code><br>
       <code class='indent'> digitalWrite(LED, LOW);</code><br>
       <code class='indent'> delay(200);</code><br>
       <code>}</code><br> 
     </article>
     <section class='tips'>
      <h2><span id='bold'>Helpful tip</span></h2>
       <p> If the LED is connected to a different pin, simply change the LED value to
the value of the pin that has been used.</p>
     </section>
     <section class='tips'>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
       <p id='text'>This is all semiconductor magic. When the second digital pin is set to HIGH , the Arduino
provides 5 V of electricity, which travels through the resistor to the LED and GND. When
enough voltage and current is present, the LED will light up. The resistor limits the amount
of current passing through the LED. Without it, it is possible that the LED (or worse, the
Arduino pin) will burn. Try to avoid using LEDs without resistors; this can easily destroy the
LED or even your Arduino.</p><br>

       <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
        <p>The code simply turns the LED on, waits, and then turns it off again. Compared to the
previous recipe, in this one we will use a blocking approach by using the delay() function.
If you look back at the code segment of this webpage, we declared the LED pin on digital pin 2:</p>
        <p>In the loop() function in the code segment, we continuously turn the LED on, wait 200 milliseconds, and then
we turn it off. After turning it off we need to wait another 200 milliseconds, otherwise it will
instantaneously turn on again and we will only see a permanently on LED.
